    Avian influenza A virus infection in people cannot be diagnosed by clinical signs<br>
    and symptoms alone; laboratory testing is needed. Avian influenza A virus<br>
    infection is usually diagnosed by collecting a swab from the upper respiratory<br>
    tract (nose or throat) of the sick person. (Testing is more accurate when the swab<br>
    is collected during the first few days of illness.) This specimen is sent to a<br>
    laboratory; the laboratory looks for avian influenza A virus either by using a<br>
    molecular test, by trying to grow the virus, or both. (Growing avian influenza A<br>
    viruses should only be done in laboratories with high levels of biosafety.)<br>
    For critically ill patients, collection and testing of lower respiratory tract<br>
    specimens also may lead to diagnosis of avian influenza virus infection. However<br>
    for some patients who are no longer very sick or who have fully recovered, it may<br>
    be difficult to detect the avian influenza A virus in the specimen. Sometimes it<br>
    may still be possible to diagnose avian influenza A virus infection by looking for<br>
    evidence of antibodies the body has produced in response to the virus. This is<br>
    not always an option because it requires two blood specimens (one taken during<br>
    the first week of illness and another taken 3-4 weeks later). Also, it can take<br>
    several weeks to verify the results, and testing must be performed in a special<br>
    laboratory, such as at CDC.<br>
