   About the vaccines for Bird flu
  </h1>
   A vaccine has been manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur.One multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in healthy<br>
    adults, 18 to 64 years of age, investigated the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. A total of 103 <br>
    healthy adults received a 90 microgram dose of the vaccine by injection, followed by another 90 <br>
    microgram dose, 28 days later. In addition, there were approximately another 300 healthy adults <br>
    who received the vaccine at doses lower than 90 micrograms and a total of 48 who received placebo <br>
    by injection.<br>
 
Of the various doses tested, the study showed that the 90 microgram dose had the better immune<br>
    response, meaning that at this particular dose, the vaccine induced the most antibodies in the blood<br>
    against the H5N1 influenza virus strain. The 90 microgram two-dose regimen produced levels of <br>
    antibodies expected to reduce the risk of getting H5N1 influenza in 45% of those who received it.<br>
    Although the remaining individuals did not develop this level of antibody, current scientific<br>
    information on other influenza vaccines, suggests that less than optimal antibody levels may still <br>
    have the potential to help reduce disease severity and influenza-related hospitalizations, and deaths.<br>

      What are the risks associated with the vaccine?
    </h1>
    The vaccine was generally well-tolerated by the recipients in the study, with<br>
    pain and tenderness at the injection site, headache, general ill feeling, and <br>
    muscle pain being the most common complaints. However, because the<br>
    number of people studied was small, rare safety events may not have been <br>
    identified, but given the potential risk of a pandemic, which can cause serious<br>
    illness and death; its benefits outweigh its risks. In addition, Sanofi Pasteur<br>
    has agreed to work with the U.S. government to gather additional information<br>
    on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine should it be used in the event of a<br>
    pandemic.<br>
    <h1>
      How is the vaccine administered
    </h1>
    It is administered as a two-dose regimen. One 90 microgram dose is given<br>
    intramuscularly, in the upper arm, and a second 90 microgram dose is given in the<br>
    same manner, 28 days later.<br>
    <h1>
      Is it possible to become infected with avian influenza from the H5N1 vaccine?
    </h1>
    No. The vaccine is made from killed influenza viruses, and they cannot cause influenza infection.<br>
